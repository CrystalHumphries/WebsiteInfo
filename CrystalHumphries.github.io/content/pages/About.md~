This blog is documenting my journey to improve my skills as a data scientist. 
Feel free to post your comments and/or questions below each blog entry. 

**Me:**

I am a budding data scientist living in Seattle.

**Current Skills:**

I have a PhD in Human Genetics and Genomics. During my PhD I taught myself programing and applied a lot of knowledge gained from JHU's MOOC towards data analysis. Up until recently, I was using my skills to mine data on health care records and 'OMIC (e.g. whole genome, RNA-seq, etc.) datato improve diagnosis.

**The Goal of this Blog is to:**
     	 
	 A) Answer some interesting questions 
	 B) Show how one goes from being a post-doc to a data scientist (I hope)
	 C) Points out steps needed along my journey
	 D) Find some others out there that have similar interests
