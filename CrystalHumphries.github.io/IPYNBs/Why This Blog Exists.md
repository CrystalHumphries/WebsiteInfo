Title: Why This Blog Exists

The reason I am making this blog is because I have been looking into how a person can become a data scientist and I could not find adqeuate information. With this blog, I hope to demonstrate how one transitions from an academic scientist to a data scientist. I hope that I can shed some light on the necessary steps required to land a position in data science. 
    
My current skills include (1 to 5, 5 highest):
    
    a) SQL              -- 2
    B) Perl             -- 4
    C) Python           -- 3
    D) Stats            -- 3
    E) R                -- 4
    F) ML techniques    -- 1
    G) Data Structures* -- 1
    F) Recursion/search -- 1

To gain the skils needed, I need to bring most of these up to a level four. In order to do that, I have enrolled myself in the Immersive Galvanize DS Bootcamp < link: http://galvanize.com/courses/data-science/>. The course involves me attending class five days a week 9am through 6:30pm. 

This is the syllabus for the course:

    Week 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Software Engineering Best Practices
    Week 2 - Statistical Inference, Bayesian Methods, A/B Testing, Multi-Armed Bandit
    Week 3 - Regression, Regularization, Gradient Descent
    Week 4 - Supervised Machine Learning: Classification, Validation, Ensemble Methods
    Week 5 - Clustering, Topic Modeling (NMF, LDA), NLP
    Week 6 - Network Analysis, Matrix Factorization, and Time Series
    Week 7 - Hadoop, Hive, and MapReduce
    Week 8 - Data Visualization with D3.js, Data Products, and Fraud Detection Case Study

During each week,
A) Summarize what I learned and B) I will highlight one or two examples to share

In the (unlikley) event I have free time, I will do a similar analysis online on freely available data. 


*I frequently use arrays and hashes. I know of trees, stacks, and queues, but I have not used them often.
