    "The reason I am making this blog is because I have been looking into how a person can become a data scientist and I could not find adqeuate information. With this blog, I hope to demonstrate how one transitions from an academic scientist to a data scientist. I hope that I can shed some light on the necessary steps required to land a position in data science. \n",
